Hello! My name is Gurjyot Singh. I am a computer engineering student at Mississippi State University. 
In my free time, I enjoy playing my flute and watching YouTube. An animal I have a fascination with is the bird.
I own a lovely parakeet named Coco and I have plans on buying a larger parrot sometime in the future.
